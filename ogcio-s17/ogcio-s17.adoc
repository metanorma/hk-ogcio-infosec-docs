== PURPOSE
With the effective use of Internet services and general adoption of cloud and mobile computing, the security and survivability of information systems are essential to the economy and the society. Our increasing dependence on IT for office works and public services delivery has brought new business focus that the key information systems and data we rely on have to be secure and actively protected for the smooth operations of all government bureaux and departments (B/Ds), underpinning public confidence, security and privacy are fundamental to the effective, efficient and safe conduct of government business.

This document outlines the mandatory minimum security requirements for the protection of all HKSAR Government's information systems and data assets. B/Ds shall develop, document, implement, maintain and review appropriate security measures to protect their information systems and data assets by:

- Establishing appropriate IT security policy, planning and governance within the B/D in line with this document, including adopting all frameworks and requirements;
- Ensuring appropriate security measures are implemented as detailed in this document;
- Ensuring regular review on continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the security measures; and
- Improving the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the security measures.
The security requirements in this document are designed to be technology neutral. The policy requirements focus on the fundamental objectives and controls to protect information during processing, while in storage, and during transmission.



== SCOPE

=== Applicability
This document adopts and adapts the security areas and controls specified in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards on information security management systems (ISO/IEC 27001:2013) and code of practice for information security controls (ISO/IEC 27002:2013). This document addresses mandatory security considerations in the following 14 areas:


- Management responsibilities (see <<management-responsibilities>>);
- IT security policies (see <<it-security-policies>>);
- Human resource security (see <<human-resource-security>>);
- Asset management (see <<asset-management>>);
- Access control (see <<access-control>>);
- Cryptography (see <<cryptography>>);
- Physical and environmental security (see <<physical-and-environmental-security>>);
- Operations security (see <<operations-security>>);
- Communications security (see <<communications-security>>);
- System acquisition, development and maintenance (see <<system-acquisition-development-and-maintenance>>);
- Outsourcing security (see <<outsourcing-security>>);
- Security incident management (see <<security-incident-management>>);
- IT security aspects of business continuity management (see <<it-security-aspects-of-business-continuity-management>>); and
- Compliance (see <<compliance>>)

It sets the minimum security requirements. B/Ds need to apply enhanced security measures, appropriate to their circumstances and commensurate with the determined risks.


=== Target Audience
The policy statements are developed for all levels of staff acting in different roles within B/Ds, including management staff, IT administrators, and general IT end users. It is the responsibility for ALL staff to read through the entire document to understand and follow IT security policies accordingly.

In addition, the document is intended for reference by the vendors, contractors and consultants who provide IT services to the Government.

=== Government IT Security Documents
The Government has promulgated a set of security regulations and government IT security policy and guidelines to assist B/Ds in formulating and implementing their IT security policies and control measures to safeguard government’s information security. B/Ds shall comply with the policy requirements in both the Security Regulations (SR) and the Baseline IT Security Policy (S17), and follow the implementation guidance in the IT Security Guidelines (G3).

The following diagram describes the relationship of various IT security documents within the Government:

[[security-regulations]]
==== Security Regulations
Security Regulations, authorised by Security Bureau, provides directives on what documents, material and information need to be classified and to ensure that they are given an adequate level of protection in relation to the conduct of government business. Chapter IX provides specific requirements to regulate the security of government records in electronic form.

[[government-it-security-policy-and-guidelines]]
==== Government IT Security Policy and Guidelines
Government IT Security Policy and Guidelines, established by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, aim at providing a reference to facilitate the implementation of information security measures to safeguard information assets. They are made heavy reference to the recognised International standards on information security management systems (ISO/IEC 27001:2013) and code of practice for information security controls (ISO/IEC 27002:2013).

They set out the minimum standards of security requirements and provide guidance on implementing appropriate security measures to protect the information assets and information systems.


Baseline IT Security Policy (S17):: A top-level directive statement that sets the minimum standards of a security specification for all B/Ds. It states what aspects are of paramount importance to a B/D. Thus, the Baseline IT Security Policy can be treated as basic rules which shall be observed as mandatory while there can still be other desirable measures to enhance the security.

IT Security Guidelines (G3):: Elaborates on the policy requirements and sets the implementation standard on the security requirements specified in the Baseline IT Security Policy. B/Ds shall follow the IT Security Guidelines for effective implementation of the security requirements.

For topical issues and specific technical requirements, a series of practice guides are developed to support the IT Security Guidelines. Supplementary documents provides guidance notes on specific security areas to assist B/Ds to address and mitigate risks brought by emerging technologies and security threats.

All practice guides are available at the ITG InfoStation under the IT Security Theme Page (https://itginfo.ccgo.hksarg/content/itsecure/techcorner/practices.shtml).


==== Departmental IT Security Policies, Procedures and Guidelines
B/Ds shall formulate their own departmental IT policies, procedures and guidelines based on all the government security requirements and implementation guidance specified in the Security Regulations and the Government IT Security Policy and Guidelines mentioned in <<security-regulations>> and <<government-it-security-policy-and-guidelines>> above.

- Safekeep computing and storage devices, and protect them from unauthorised access or malicious attack with his/her best effort.


== CORE SECURITY PRINCIPLES
This section introduces some generally accepted principles that address information security from a very high-level viewpoint. These principles are fundamental in nature, and rarely change. B/Ds shall observe these principles for developing, implementing and understanding security policies. The principles listed below are by no means exhaustive.

- *Information System Security Objectives* +
Information system security objectives or goals are described in terms of three overall objectives: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Security policies and measures shall be developed and implemented according to these objectives.

- *Risk Based Approach* +
A risk based approach shall be adopted to identify, prioritise and address the security risks of information systems in a consistent and effective manner. Proper security measures shall be implemented to protect information assets and systems and mitigate security risks to an acceptable level.

- *Prevent, Detect, Respond and Recover* +
Information security is a combination of preventive, detective, response and recovery measures. Preventive measures avoid or deter the occurrence of an undesirable event. Detective measures identify the occurrence of an undesirable event. Response measures refer to coordinated actions to contain damage when an undesirable event (or incident) occurs. Recovery measures are for restoring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems to their expected state.

- *Protection of information while being processed, in transit, and in storage* +
Security measures shall be considered and implemented as appropriate to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information while it is being processed, in transit, and in storage. As an example, a wireless communication without protection is vulnerable to attacks, security measures shall be adopted when transmitting classified information.

- *External systems are assumed to be insecure* +
In general, an external system shall be assumed to be insecure. When B/Ds’ information assets or information systems connect with external systems, B/Ds shall implement security measures, using either physical or logical means, according to the business requirements and the associated risk levels.

- *Resilience for critical information systems* +
All critical information systems shall be resilient to stand against major disruptive events, with measures in place to detect disruption, minimise damage and rapidly respond and recover. Damage containment shall be considered in the resilience plan and implemented as appropriate with an aim to limit the scope, magnitude and impact of an incident for effective recovery.

- *Auditability and Accountability* +
Security shall require auditability and accountability. Auditability refers to the ability to verify the activities in an information system. Evidence used for verification can take form of audit trails, system logs, alarms, or other notifications. Accountability refers to the ability to audit the actions of all parties and processes which interact with information systems. Roles and responsibilities shall be clearly defined, identified, and authorised at a level commensurate with the sensitivity of information.

- *Continual Improvement* +
To be responsive and adaptive to a changing environment and to new technology, a continual improvement process shall be implemented for monitoring, reviewing and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of IT security management. Performance of security measures shall be evaluated periodically to determine whether IT security objectives are met.
