This changes the mode of Internet usage and also brings together new risks in daily operations. While mobile devices and mobile applications (apps) installed in the devices bring convenience and improve efficiency, insecure protection of mobile devices or insecurely written mobile apps pose risks to mobile users and may cause data loss or reputation damage to the app owner. In view of the extra risks introduced by mobile devices due to its high portability, wireless connection capabilities and diverse techniques in mobile app development, this practice guide is developed to provide guidance notes for Bureaux/Departments (B/Ds) to make reference in securing the use of mobile devices in their business and the development of mobile apps for business use.</p>

	<p id="_5609d1b5-baa9-c1eb-05b0-eb36feaf86fd">Information security is about the planning, implementation and continuous enhancement of security controls and measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets, whether in storage, processing, or transmission and its associated information systems. Information security management is a set of principles relating to the functions of planning, organising, directing, controlling, and the application of these principles in harnessing physical, financial, human and informational resources efficiently and effectively to assure the safety of information assets and information systems.
	Information security management involves a series of activities that require continuous monitoring and control. These activities include but not limited to the following functional areas:</p>

	<title>Introduction to Mobile Security</title>
	<p id="_d4581c2e-e23e-40ea-c3d1-7548239d1fb5">As technologies advance, the computational power of mobile devices continues to increase, and at the same time they become even smaller and lighter. While there are many obvious advantages with these devices, they also bring security concerns that need to be addressed. Also, while mobile apps bring much convenience to users, poorly written mobile apps increase risk of data loss. This section highlights the security measures and best practices to address the common security concerns and illustrates how they should be incorporated in the major stages of mobile device management life cycle and mobile app development life cycle. B/Ds may select and map the security measures and best practices to their own management and development life cycle model based on their business needs.</p>

This has come to be known as containerisation, the securing of business apps and their associated data within digital containers (either physical or virtual) that govern app behaviour and prevent unauthorised interaction with personal apps.</p>
