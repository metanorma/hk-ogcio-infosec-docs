	<p id="_acfd0048-376a-e390-6158-c2685fd77036">Nowadays, new generation of network printers are “smart” machines that have central processing units, the capability of storing information they processed in their internal storage devices; and connecting to wired or wireless networks. With these capabilities, most of the current network printers can be used for more than just printing; they can also be used for copying, scanning, faxing and emailing documents. Some of the network printers even have internal servers or routers. Hence, network printers are similar to other computer equipment which could be suffered from various types of security threats (e.g. data leakage) if they are not properly protected / used.</p>

	<title>Information Security Management</title>
	<p id="_71f579a6-d180-acdc-c4f1-274a0cd23c40">Information security is about the planning, implementation and continuous enhancement of security controls and measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets, whether in storage, processing, or transmission and its associated information systems. Information security management is a set of principles relating to the functions of planning, organising, directing, controlling, and the application of these principles in harnessing physical, financial, human and informational resources efficiently and effectively to assure the safety of information assets and information systems.</p>
	
	<p id="_5d0529d4-09f9-68d6-5fe2-46dd7e4ecd11">Information security management involves a series of activities that require continuous monitoring and control. These activities include but not limited to the following functional areas:</p>

	<title>Network Printer Security</title>
	<p id="_d56c6d00-e0dd-4cf3-988c-380be2bf2847">In information security management, the “Security Operations” functional area includes the deployment of proper security protection and safeguards to reduce the risk of successful attacks. In light of the ever-increasing abilities of network printers which have the similar capabilities of networked computer equipment, network printers are also facing similar security threats that need to be properly managed. Network printer security is, therefore, a major area under the “Security Operations” functional area of information security management.</p>
	
	<p id="_5236d293-253f-6a2f-23cc-e4563c331872">This section highlights the security measures and best practices to address the common security concerns and illustrates how they should be incorporated in the major stages of network printer management life cycle including provision, use and decommission. B/Ds may select and map the security measures and best practices to their own management life cycle model based on their business needs.</p>

	<p id="_aaa9d392-2ecc-b0d7-f665-ec2b640c0210">Network printers have the capabilities of storing data in their storage devices and connecting to wired or wireless networks for printing, copying, scanning, faxing and emailing documents. They can also use network protocols commonly available in computer equipment, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), Hyper Text Transport Protocol Secure (HTTPS), Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), Server Message Block (SMB), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and telnet. Hence, network printers expose similar security threats faced by other connected computing devices. Major threats applicable to network printers are highlighted below. B/Ds should take reference of these common security threats and avoid them in using network printers.</p>

Therefore, this section focuses on the best practices related to on-going operation process for the management of network printers whereas best practices for using network printers by end-users are provided at <xref target="annex-use-network"/>.</p>
