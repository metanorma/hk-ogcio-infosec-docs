<p id="_acfd0048-376a-e390-6158-c2685fd77036">Nowadays, new generation of network printers are “smart” machines that have central processing units, the capability of storing information they processed in their internal storage devices; and connecting to wired or wireless networks. With these capabilities, most of the current network printers can be used for more than just printing; they can also be used for copying, scanning, faxing and emailing documents. Some of the network printers even have internal servers or routers. Hence, network printers are similar to other computer equipment which could be suffered from various types of security threats (e.g. data leakage) if they are not properly protected / used.</p>

<p id="_1a388b78-0090-53d9-692a-814f22ea499f">This practice guide is developed to provide guidance notes for Bureaux/Departments (B/Ds) to make reference in securing the use of network printers in their offices.</p>

<p id="_a692876e-2508-4deb-ac51-7d206b56018d">This document provides guidance notes for the administration and other technical and operational staff who are involved in managing network printers. Common security considerations and best practices on major stages of network printer management life cycle for using network printers are provided in this document. B/Ds should consider the security measures and best practices recommended in this document and implement adequate security protection for their network printers. This document should be used in conjunction with the established government requirements and documents including Baseline IT Security Policy [S17], IT Security Guidelines [G3], relevant procedures and guidelines, where applicable. In addition to the government security requirements, B/Ds should assess the security risks before the adoption of network printers based on their business needs.</p>

<p id="_7327035d-6e32-796b-57f6-5bbec4b278ad">This document is intended to provide practical guidance notes on and references for management and use of network printers in the offices.

<p id="_d56c6d00-e0dd-4cf3-988c-380be2bf2847">In information security management, the “Security Operations” functional area includes the deployment of proper security protection and safeguards to reduce the risk of successful attacks. In light of the ever-increasing abilities of network printers which have the similar capabilities of networked computer equipment, network printers are also facing similar security threats that need to be properly managed. Network printer security is, therefore, a major area under the “Security Operations” functional area of information security management.</p>

<p id="_5236d293-253f-6a2f-23cc-e4563c331872">This section highlights the security measures and best practices to address the common security concerns and illustrates how they should be incorporated in the major stages of network printer management life cycle including provision, use and decommission.

<title depth="2">5.1.<tab/>Security Concerns of Network Printers</title>
<p id="_aaa9d392-2ecc-b0d7-f665-ec2b640c0210">Network printers have the capabilities of storing data in their storage devices and connecting to wired or wireless networks for printing, copying, scanning, faxing and emailing documents. They can also use network protocols commonly available in computer equipment, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), Hyper Text Transport Protocol Secure (HTTPS), Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), Server Message Block (SMB), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and telnet. Hence, network printers expose similar security threats faced by other connected computing devices. Major threats applicable to network printers are highlighted below. B/Ds should take reference of these common security threats and avoid them in using network printers.</p>

Some potential threats, vulnerabilities, and related exploits associated with network connectivity include:</p>

<ul id="_58d1e188-a7a1-fd4c-605a-a78f0ab723ed"><li><p id="_0c3dfd5d-bd76-a155-55e2-30675c925c5a">Unencrypted information — Any information, including configuration data or passwords, sent unencrypted to network printers could be intercepted, exposed and/or altered.</p>
