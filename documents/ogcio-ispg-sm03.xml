<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="_2f668083-4236-5f09-4758-845eb2c0c4ff">Mobile devices are getting more common and allow users to access information from anywhere at any time. This changes the mode of Internet usage and also brings together new risks in daily operations. While mobile devices and mobile applications (apps) installed in the devices bring convenience and improve efficiency, insecure protection of mobile devices or insecurely written mobile apps pose risks to mobile users and may cause data loss or reputation damage to the app owner. In view of the extra risks introduced by mobile devices due to its high portability, wireless connection capabilities and diverse techniques in mobile app development, this practice guide is developed to provide guidance notes for Bureaux/Departments (B/Ds) to make reference in securing the use of mobile devices in their business and the development of mobile apps for business use.</p>

<clause id="_purpose" obligation="normative">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p id="_9c1d5db4-8029-7428-4459-5767846afa06">The purpose of this document is to provide common security considerations and best practices to B/Ds on the management and use of mobile devices as well as secure development of mobile apps. The best practices on the use and management of mobile devices are described in <xref target="sec-mobile-device-security"/> and they are intended for staff who are involved in the use and adoption of mobile devices and related management solutions. The security best practices on mobile app development are described in <xref target="sec-mobile-app-development-security"/> and they are intended for developers who are involved in related development life cycle.</p>

<p id="_d694367b-a8e9-03d8-7503-570f41b9b699">This document should be used in conjunction with established government requirements and documents including the Baseline IT Security Policy [S17], the IT Security Guidelines [G3] and other relevant procedures and guidelines, where applicable. In addition to government security requirements, B/Ds should also assess the security risks before adoption of mobile device solutions based on their business needs. B/Ds should consider the security measures and best practices recommended in this document and implement adequate security protection for their mobile solutions.</p>

<p id="_3e620603-8080-5866-85b4-5411a8db9761">The materials included in this document are general in nature and are prepared irrespective of the types or platforms of the mobile devices.

<title>Introduction to Mobile Security</title>
<p id="_d4581c2e-e23e-40ea-c3d1-7548239d1fb5">As technologies advance, the computational power of mobile devices continues to increase, and at the same time they become even smaller and lighter. While there are many obvious advantages with these devices, they also bring security concerns that need to be addressed. Also, while mobile apps bring much convenience to users, poorly written mobile apps increase risk of data loss. This section highlights the security measures and best practices to address the common security concerns and illustrates how they should be incorporated in the major stages of mobile device management life cycle and mobile app development life cycle. B/Ds may select and map the security measures and best practices to their own management and development life cycle model based on their business needs.</p>

<clause id="_security_concerns_of_mobile_technologies" obligation="normative">
<title>Security Concerns of Mobile Technologies</title>
<p id="_c4c77c36-edbc-84a3-80ba-ffcc6186a853">Security threats to mobile devices come from many directions. Mobile devices often need additional protection because their nature generally places them at higher exposure to threats than other client devices, such as a workstation in the office area. Major threats to mobile devices can come from the device itself, network (e.g. mobile, internet) or application (e.g. mobile app, mobile web app). The security concerns of mobile technologies are highlighted below:</p>

<p id="_15c877ff-7330-1cde-63a5-ed5e0b4b8702"><strong>Device</strong></p>

<ul id="_014311f6-267c-bf59-b518-254851ea305c"><li><p id="_fdec5b79-33bc-05ce-bcdf-5b1f85e5102d">Lack of physical security controls</p>
<p id="_7ea94d49-0ecc-47a1-6789-3070197b09ba">Mobile devices are typically used in a variety of locations outside the B/Ds’ control, such as employees’ homes, coffee shops, hotels, and conferences. The devices’ mobile nature makes them much more likely to be lost or stolen than other devices, so their data is at increased risk of compromise.</p>

<p id="_9c854f48-c7d5-68bf-a28d-568e32f3717a">Mobile devices are designed to make them easy to find, acquire, install, and use third-party applications from mobile app stores. This poses obvious security risks, especially when mobile device platforms and mobile app stores do not place security restrictions or other limitations on the published applications developed by third-party.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_557a1068-95c7-004a-9c09-b1bbf674b324">Use of location services</p>
<p id="_55ecf756-e036-5ba9-67ec-e0d354c42c56">Location services are commonly used by social media, navigation, web browsers, and other mobile-centric applications to identify the locations of mobile devices and its owner. Mobile devices with location services enabled are at increased risk of targeted attacks because it is easier for potential attackers to determine where the user and the mobile device are, and to correlate that information with other sources to launch attacks such as spear phishing.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_c3e7d606-aa73-a5c9-7bbe-1f9e68b2721b">Use of untrusted source</p>
<p id="_f20526f6-aabe-977c-04d4-79f7791424a0">Mobile apps may induce untrusted input from malicious source that are not common to other types of devices. An example is the 2D barcode, which are now commonly used because camera is a built-in component in today’s smartphones and tablets. This could induce targeted attacks, such as placing malicious 2D barcodes at a public location.</p>

<p id="_dbd10050-7022-d0a3-ed86-a944c09158ed">The above paragraphs discuss on the general security concerns on mobile technology and its application. When developing mobile apps, further security risks need to be addressed. The developer can refer to Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Mobile Top 10 to understand those critical risks that mobile app development faces. B/Ds should take reference of these common security risks and avoid such problems in their codes. B/Ds should also review and define the security requirements of their applications to mitigate risks so as to avoid vulnerabilities originated from security design. The risks as mentioned by OWASP are highlighted below:</p>

<ul id="_c462dbec-5a71-0e0f-c845-a43a55593909"><li><p id="_63dce921-3598-3615-a14a-0dab655ceab4">Improper Platform Usage</p>
<p id="_89874193-3b63-12be-902b-3f6b27c754fe">The potential threat comes from the misuse of a platform feature and failure to use platform security controls, e.g., Android intents, platform permissions, misuse of biometric recognition features or other security controls of the mobile operating system. Misusing platform features may put the system under risk (e.g., cross-site scripting).</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_fe46b82d-0208-891e-9c16-60b5884fd323">Insecure Data Storage</p>
<p id="_e48eb871-af74-ad0d-5c52-5cfa9d4f21a2">Insecure data storage vulnerabilities occur when development teams assume that users or malware will not have access to a mobile device’s filesystem and subsequent sensitive information on the device. This can result in data loss or extraction of the app’s sensitive information via mobile malware, modified apps or forensic tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_021a7393-5ef8-4df1-26c6-6324a15fd38a">Insecure Communication</p>
<p id="_2ec99052-76c8-ce42-ea87-fe20afa3ea52">Insecure communications from one point to another put the app data at risk of exposure, which may cause possible leakage of sensitive information over the network communication. The issue could be caused by poor handshaking, incorrect SSL versions, weak negotiation and plain text communication of sensitive assets.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_3c321033-8854-8192-fa83-6c7866a5093e">Insecure Authentication</p>
<p id="_6c0375c8-6a58-a869-6625-6d5c6fe84021">Attackers may compromise passwords, keys, or authentication tokens to impersonate the identity of other users. The issue could be caused by the absence or improper implementation of authentication mechanisms and bad session management.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_df8df01d-1488-cfa4-c08c-2d3afad4721e">Insufficient Cryptography</p>
<p id="_c17bc693-ef93-ccab-1c6c-bf23f291d2f2">Attackers may steal or access poorly protected data resulting from missing or improper use of cryptographic functions to encrypt sensitive information assets.</p>

<li><p id="_c03d98a6-055f-f851-d477-55bf7573ac9f">Insecure Authorisation</p>
<p id="_906dbdd3-687f-f023-c6d7-02d43e835a2a">Attackers may bypass the authorisation mechanism and execute over-privileged functionality. The issue could be caused by the failure of a server to correctly enforce identity and permissions as defined by the mobile app, if the mobile app only trusts the client-side authorisation but fails to perform server-side authorisation.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_79fe8751-dbc0-09ef-4811-8199b63e26ad">Client Code Quality</p>
<p id="_4ec289a3-9bcb-e900-e2c6-db1555a79f1f">Poor client codes may lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and memory leaks by passing malicious input to the mobile app. This may result in foreign code execution or denial of service on remote server.</p>

<title>Containerisation Technology</title>
<p id="_def77ba2-dd64-e3c6-7366-1bd811f332f1">The central aspect of a mobile management strategy is creating distinct lines of separation on privately-owned mobile devices between users’ personal apps and business apps and their associated data. This has come to be known as containerisation, the securing of business apps and their associated data within digital containers (either physical or virtual) that govern app behaviour and prevent unauthorised interaction with personal apps.</p>

<p id="_2c93f233-d512-be82-b6ec-7910653b5de8">With the various container offerings from different vendors, there are three main types of containerisation, namely, physical container, virtual container and per-app container.</p>

<clause id="_physical_container" obligation="normative">
<title>Physical Container</title>
<p id="_a1327854-e90d-7f0e-1bfe-a2ed2e45a9cc">Working at the chipset or kernel level of a mobile device to separate business apps and their data from a user’s personal apps. Physical containers creates hardware level segmentation between a mobile user’s business environment and personal environment. Implying a separate OS stack at the kernel level just for business apps to reside and operate. This OS stack is completely distinct from the mobile device’s normal OS stack where the users’ regular apps reside. As it is a separated domain, administrators can enforce organisation specific security requirements to that particular “Physical Container”. A key security aspect of physical containers is that the OS stack typically has to leverage processor-specific capabilities.</p>

<p id="_abc52879-9098-a6e9-ef20-29ceb6914397">One of the biggest benefits offered by physical containers is the top to bottom secure isolation that they offer between the separate OS stack and the device’s normal OS stack, ensuring that no interaction can occur between business and personal apps. Since it is a separated platform, the vulnerability will not inherit from mobile device.</p>

<p id="_ebb31252-1bb6-d9f1-0236-1163b36fe090">However, this stack-level isolation also creates one of the major drawbacks inherent to physical container solutions—disruption of the user experience. Whenever users are logged into the mobile devices’ normal OS stack, they have to exit and enter into the separate OS stack anytime they want to use a corporate app. When they want to use a personal app, they have to reverse the process. The constant switching between physical containers not only creates user inconvenience, but also would affect user productivity over an extended period of time. Currently, this kind of solution is OS dependent; third-party and internal software developers have to customise the application to support the physical container.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_virtual_container" obligation="normative">
<title>Virtual Container</title>
<p id="_1d4a042a-af1a-8a30-9480-c7da7bb2602f">Business apps are segmented within an encrypted workspace inside the operating system comparable to a single sandbox with multiple apps running inside it. Policies are implemented to govern what types of interactions may occur among apps inside the virtual container. All interactions between business apps in the container stay within the container. Likewise, all of the data associated with the virtual container’s apps remains secure within the confines of the virtual sandbox.</p>

<p id="_7a77d0a6-58e5-7e94-7655-0bc301bca364">Mobile users is required to input a separated password for authenticating the container and perform business activities. With the adoption of virtual container, the logical separation between the business apps and personal apps is executed by the operating system and kernel. Since the container is run inside the mobile device, the vulnerabilities of the operating system and kernel may affect the security of container. Furthermore, the solution requires third-party and internal software developers to develop or modify their apps to support a vendor-specific container environment. Virtual container strategies also requires specific skills and additional administration effort in the on-going support activities.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_per_app_container" obligation="normative">
<title>Per-App Container</title>
<p id="_709a094b-8f40-2c9e-5fd3-2c7740b4310f">Per-app container provides a secure self-contained sandbox to each individual app and its associated data, which can provide more granular control to its administrators in securing organisational data, while presenting users a more seamless user experiences. Under this model, administrators can choose to configure general policies that apply to all apps, specific policies for individual apps, or a combination of both. Administrators can also granularly control the directional flow of data for each app, such as inbound and outbound communications. Additionally, since each contained app’s data is individually encrypted and secured by policy, the business app will remain protected if a malicious app happens to infect the mobile device.</p>

<p id="_0d183323-570e-6e46-cfef-7fd75e784bb9">As enforcement is on per-app basis, users typically do not have to constantly enter and exit contained and non-contained environments to switch between personal apps and business apps. Users can easily see and access all the apps they are authorised to use whether they are personal or corporate apps. The combination of the per-app policy governance and application-level encryption gives B/Ds the additional level of security they need to keep their business apps and data safe.</p>
