== Information Security Management

Information security is about the planning, implementation and continuous enhancement of security controls and measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets, whether in storage, processing, or transmission and its associated information systems. Information security management is a set of principles relating to the functions of planning, organising, directing, controlling, and the application of these principles in harnessing physical, financial, human and informational resources efficiently and effectively to assure the safety of information assets and information systems.

Information security management involves a series of activities that require continuous monitoring and control. These activities include but not limited to the following functional areas:

* Security Management Framework and the Organisation;

* Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance;

* Security Operations;

* Security Event and Incident Management;

* Awareness Training and Capability Building; and

* Situational Awareness and Information Sharing.

*Security Management Framework and Organisation*

B/Ds shall establish and enforce departmental information security policies, standards, guidelines and procedures in accordance with the business needs and the government security requirements.

B/Ds shall also define the organisation structure on information security and provide clear definitions and proper assignment of security accountability and responsibility to involved parties.

*Governance, Risk Management and Compliance*

B/Ds shall adopt a risk based approach to identify, prioritise and address the security risks of information systems in a consistent and effective manner.

B/Ds shall perform security risk assessments for information systems and production applications periodically and when necessary so as to identify risks and consequences associated with vulnerabilities, and to provide a basis to establish a cost-effective security program and implement appropriate security protection and safeguards.

B/Ds shall also perform security audit on information systems regularly to ensure that current security measures comply with departmental information security policies, standards, and other contractual or legal requirements.

*Security Operations*

To protect information assets and information systems, B/Ds should implement comprehensive security measures based on their business needs, covering different technological areas in their business, and adopt the principle of "Prevent, Detect, Respond and Recover" in their daily operations.

* Preventive measures avoid or deter the occurrence of an undesirable event;

* Detective measures identify the occurrence of an undesirable event;

* Response measures refer to coordinated actions to contain damage when an undesirable event or incident occurs; and

* Recovery measures are for restoring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems to their expected state.

*Security Event and Incident Management*

In reality, security incidents might still occur due to unforeseeable, disruptive events. In cases where security events compromise business continuity or give rise to risk of data security, B/Ds shall activate their standing incident management plan to identifying, managing, recording, and analysing security threats, attacks, or incidents in real-time. B/Ds should also prepare to communicate appropriately with relevant parties by sharing information on response for security risks to subdue distrust or unnecessary speculation. When developing an incident management plan, B/Ds should plan and prepare the right resources as well as develop the procedures to address necessary follow-up investigations.

*Awareness Training and Capability Building*

As information security is everyone’s business, B/Ds should continuously promote information security awareness throughout the organisations and arrange training and education to ensure that all related parties understand the risks, observe the security regulations and requirements, and conform to security best practices.

*Situational Awareness and Information Sharing*

As cyber threat landscape is constantly changing, B/Ds should also constantly attend to current vulnerabilities information, threat alerts, and important notices disseminated by the security industry and the GovCERT.HK. The security alerts on impending and actual threats should be disseminated to and shared with those responsible colleagues within B/Ds so that timely mitigation measures could be taken.

B/Ds could make use of the cyber risk information sharing platform to receive and share information regarding security issues, vulnerabilities, and cyber threat intelligence.

== Introduction to Security Risk Assessment and Audit

=== Security Risk Assessment and Audit

Security risk assessment and audit is an ongoing process of information security practices to discovering and correcting security issues. They involve a series of activities as shown in Figure 3.1. They can be described as a cycle of iterative processes that require ongoing monitoring and control. Each process consists of different activities and some of which are highlighted below as examples.

[[fig1]]
.An Iterative Process of Security Risk Assessment and Audit
image::image-01.png[width=auto,height=auto]

Assessing security risk is the initial step to evaluate and identify risks and consequences associated with vulnerabilities, and to provide a basis for management to establish a cost-effective security program.

Based on the assessment results, appropriate security protection and safeguards should be implemented to maintain a secure protection framework. This includes developing new security requirements, revising existing security policies and guidelines, assigning security responsibilities and implementing technical security protections.

With implementation of secure framework, there is also the need for constant monitoring and recording so that proper arrangements can be made for tackling a security incident. In addition, day-to-day operations such as users' access attempts and activities while using a resource, or information, need to be properly monitored, audited, and logged.

This step is then followed by cyclic compliance reviews and re-assessments to provide assurance that security controls are properly put into place to meet users' security requirements, and to cope with the rapid technological and environmental changes. This model relies on continuous feedback and monitoring. The review can be done by conducting periodic security audits to identify what enhancements are necessary.

=== Security Risk Assessment vs Security Audit

Both the security risk assessment and the security audit are on-going processes but are different in terms of both nature and functions.

Security risk assessment is the process to identify, analyse and evaluate the security risks, and determine the mitigation measures to reduce the risks to an acceptable level. The risk assessment is an integral part of a risk management process designed to provide appropriate levels of security for information systems. It helps identify risks and consequences associated with vulnerabilities, and to provide a basis to establish a cost-effective security program and implement appropriate security protection and safeguards.

For a new information system, the security risk assessment is typically conducted at the beginning of the system development life cycle. For an existing system, the assessments shall be conducted on a regular basis throughout the system development life cycle or when major changes are made to the IT environment.

An information security audit is an audit on the level of compliance with the security policy and standards as a basis to determine the overall state of the existing protection and to verify whether the existing protection has been performed properly. The security audit is an on-going process to ensure that current security measures comply with departmental IT security policies, standards, and other contractual or legal requirements.

While there are similarities in certain functions, below is a highlight of the key difference between security risk assessment and security audit.

The details of the processes for conducting security risk assessment and security audit are described in <<security_risk_assessment>> and <<security_audit>> respectively.


[[security_risk_assessment]]
== Security Risk Assessment

Security risk assessment is the process to identify, analyse and evaluate the security risks, and determine the mitigation measures to reduce the risks to an acceptable level. The assessment process of a system includes the identification and analysis of :

* all assets of and processes related to the system

* threats that could affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the system

* system vulnerabilities and the associated threats

* potential impacts and risks from the threat activity

* protection requirements to mitigate the risks

* selection of appropriate security measures and analysis of the risk relationships

To obtain useful and more accurate analysis results, a complete inventory list and security requirements for a system shall be made available as inputs to the identification and analysis activities. Interviews with relevant parties such as administrators, computer / network operators, or users can also provide additional information for the analysis. The analysis may also involve the use of automated security assessment tools depending on the assessment scope, requirements and methodology. After evaluation of all collected information, a list of observed risk findings will be reported. For each of the observed risks, appropriate security measures will be determined, implemented and deployed.

Due to the high demand of expert knowledge and experiences in analysing the collected information and justifying security measures, a security risk assessment should be performed by qualified security expert(s).

=== Benefits of Security Risk Assessment

* To provide a complete and systematic view to management on existing IT security risk and on the necessary security safeguards.

* To provide a reasonably objective approach for IT security expenditure budgeting and cost estimation.

* To enable a strategic approach to information security management by providing alternative solutions for decision making and consideration.

* To provide a basis for future comparisons of changes made in IT security measures.

=== Frequency and Type of Security Risk Assessment

==== Frequency of Security Risk Assessment

Security risk assessment is an on-going activity. For a new information system, the assessment should be conducted early in the system development life cycle so that security risks can be identified and appropriate security controls can be selected at early stage. For an existing system, it shall be conducted at least once every two years or when major changes are made to explore the risks in the information systems. A security risk assessment can only give a snapshot of the risks of the information systems at a particular time. For mission-critical information system, it is recommended to conduct a security risk assessment more frequently.

==== Type of Security Risk Assessment

Depending on the purpose and the scope of the assessment, security risk assessment can be categorised into different types. The exact timing depends on your system requirements and resources.

* High-level Assessment: This assessment emphasises on the analysis of departmental security posture as well as overall infrastructure or design of a system in a more strategic and systematic approach. In such assessment, B/Ds with many information systems are looking for a high-level risk analysis of their information systems rather than a detailed and technical control review. It can also be applied for system at planning phase to identify risks or review general security controls before design of the system.

* Comprehensive Assessment: This assessment is typically conducted periodically for the security assurance of information systems of a B/D. It can be used to evaluate the risks of a particular system in a B/D and to provide recommendations for improvement. General control review, system review, and vulnerability identification will be conducted during the information gathering stage. A verification process should be followed to ensure all recommended remedies are properly followed up.

* Pre-production Assessment: Similar to the works performed in a "Comprehensive Assessment", this assessment is commonly conducted on a new information system before it is rolled out or after there is a major functional change. For a new information system, B/Ds should conduct security review in the design stage of the system, which serves as a checkpoint to ensure necessary security requirements are identified and incorporated in the system design stage or other phases appropriately. The pre-production security risk assessment should verify the follow-up actions of the security review to ensure necessary security measures and controls are implemented in the system properly before production rollout.

=== Steps on Security Risk Assessment

Security Risk Assessment involves several major activities as shown in <<fig2>>.
They are : Planning, Information Gathering, Risk Analysis, Identifying and Selecting Safeguards and Monitoring & Implementation.

[[fig2]]
.General Security Risk Assessment Steps
image::image-02.png[width=auto,height=auto]

==== Planning
Before a security risk assessment can start, planning is required for proper preparation, monitor and control. One suggestion is to inform the stakeholders, such as the network team, the application team and the security incident handling team in advance if risk assessment exercises covering penetration testing or vulnerability scanning are to be carried out to avoid excessive false alarms generated that might impact the daily operation. Below are several major items that should be defined first.

* Project Scopes and Objectives

* Background Information

* Constraints

* Roles & Responsibilities of Stakeholders

* Approach and Methodology

* Project Size and Schedule

* Data and Tools Protection


===== Project Scopes and Objectives

The project scopes and objectives can influence the style of analysis and types of deliverables of the security risk assessment. The scopes of a security risk assessment may cover the connection of the internal network with the Internet, the security protection for a computer centre, or even the information security of the whole department. Thus, the corresponding objectives may want to identify the security requirements such as protection when connecting to the Internet, to identify potentially risky areas in a computer room, or to assess the overall information security level of a department. The security requirements should be based on business needs, which are typically driven by the senior management, to identify the desired level of security protection in the B/D.

===== Background Information

It refers to any relevant information that can provide initial ideas to the consultant about the assessment. For example, the historical and current information of the system under study, the related parties, brief information about the last assessment, or the near future changes which may affect the assessment.

===== Constraints

Constraints like time, budget, cost, technology and other restrictions should also be considered. This may affect the project schedule and the available resources to support the assessment. For example, it may be necessary to perform the assessment at non-peak office hours or even at non-office hours.

[[roles_and_responsibilities_of_stakeholders]]
===== Roles and Responsibilities of Stakeholders

Roles and responsibilities of all parties involved should be carefully defined. A team or group of individuals representing a variety of disciplines with assigned responsibilities is recommended to best accomplish the assessment. Depending on the availability and requirements, some or all of the following members may be included:

* System or information owners

* IT security officers

* Computer operational staff

* System or network administrators

* Application or system developers

* Database administrators

* Users or senior users

* Senior management

* External contractors

===== Approach and Methodology

The assessment approach or methodology analyses the relationships among assets, threats, vulnerabilities and other elements. There are numerous methodologies. Generally, they can be classified into two main types : quantitative and qualitative analysis.

To be more useful, the methodology chosen should be able to produce a quantitative statement about the impact of the risk and the effect of the security problems, together with some qualitative statements describing the impact and appropriate security measures for minimising these risks. Details of the two analysis methods will be explained in subsequent sections.

===== Project Size and Schedule

One of the most important tasks is to prepare a project schedule stating all major activities that will be performed in the assessment study. The planned project size such as project cost and the number of staff involved can directly affect the project schedule. This project schedule can be used for progress control and project monitoring.

===== Data and Tools Protection

Throughout stages of the security risk assessment, a tremendous amount of data and system configurations will be collected where some of them may contain sensitive information.

Therefore, the assessment team should ensure all the collected data are stored securely. File encryption tools and lockable cabinet/room should be arranged at the planning stage to prevent unauthorised access to the sensitive data.

Besides, the assessment tools should also be properly maintained, controlled and monitored to avoid misuse. Such tools should only be run by the subject experts within the assessment team to avoid potential damages to the system. These tools should also be removed immediately after use unless there is proper control to protect them from unauthorised access.

At the end of the assessment process, a security risk assessment report will be compiled to document all the risk findings. Any unauthorised access to such information, especially before rectification, may pose immediate threats to the B/D concerned. Hence, it is crucial that the assessment team enforces proper protection on the security risk assessment report during and after the documentation process. Senior management should also be reminded to treat the security risk assessment report in strict confidence. Lastly, the assessment team should also return all requested data or documents to the B/D concerned.

[[information_gathering]]
==== Information Gathering

The objective is to understand the existing system and environment and identify the risks through analysis of the information / data collected.

By default, all relevant information should be collected irrespective of storage format. Below are several kinds of information that are often collected.

* Security requirements and objectives.

* System or network architecture and infrastructure, such as a network diagram showing how the assets are configured and interconnected.

* Information available to the public or found in the web pages.

* Physical assets such as hardware equipment.

* Systems such as operating systems, network management systems.

* Contents such as databases and files.

* Applications and servers information.

* Networking details such as supported protocols and network services offered.

* Access control measures.

* Processes such as business process, computer operation process, network operation process, application operation process, etc.

* Identification and authentication mechanisms.

* Relevant statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements pertaining to minimum security control requirements.

* Documented or informal policies and guidelines.

In general, there are two common types of information collection methods:

* General control review

* System review

===== General Control Review

This method is to identify any potential risks or threats in general controls being put in place for the current environment by examining the systems manually through interviews, site visits, documentation review, and observations, etc.

This may include, but is not limited to, the following:

* Departmental IT security organisation, in particular staff roles and responsibilities

* Management responsibilities

* IT security policies

* Human resource security, including security awareness training

* Asset management

* Access control, such as password policy, access privileges

* Cryptography

* Physical and environmental security

* Operations security

* Communications security

* System acquisition, development and maintenance

* Outsourcing security

* Security incident management

* IT security aspects of business continuity management

* Compliance


The following methods can be considered in collecting the information:

* Site Visits : visit to the data centre, computer rooms, and office environment should be arranged to identify physical security risks. In addition, assessment team should record down on-site observations about system operations and end user behaviours (e.g. the use of password-protected screensaver) in order to verify if relevant security policies are followed accordingly.

* Group Discussions : group discussions or workshops can be facilitated by the assessment team to gather information about the existing security environment (controls and risks) of the B/D or information systems. The discussion can be any format and topic, depending on the target information to be gathered.

* Multi-level Interviews : on-site interviews with key persons or representatives at different levels may also be conducted to verify previously obtained information, and to improve the accuracy and completeness of the collected information.

* Questionnaires : questionnaires or checklists are effective tools to identify the potential risks. Questionnaires can be customised and developed by the security consultants to tailor for the environment.


For example, multi-level interviews may involve different categories of staff such as:

* Senior management : who decides strategies such as scope and objective of the assessment.

* Line management : who needs to understand the main business processes and procedures that would be affected by the strategic security changes.

* Human resources personnel : who need to identify specific controls for hiring, terminations and transfers of staff related to systems security and usage rights.

* Operational and technical personnel : who provide technical and operational information.

For a high-level assessment or a design-phase assessment, the use of site visit and questionnaires methods may not be applicable or feasible. Hence, security assessment team should focus information collection from activities such as group discussion and multi-level interviews.

<<annexA>> shows a list of general questions for security risk assessment.


===== System Review

This review is to identify any vulnerabilities and weaknesses of network or systems. It will focus on operating system, administration and monitoring tools in different platforms.

Examples are:

* System files or logs

* Running processes

* Access control files

* User listing

* Configuration settings

* Security patch level

* Encryption or authentication tools

* Network management tools

* Logging or intrusion detection tools

Assessment team should also spot if there is any abnormal activity such as intrusion attempt.

To collectively gather the above information more efficiently and comprehensively, automated scripts and/or tools can be tailored to run on the target host to extract specific information about the system. Such information will be useful in the later stage of risk analysis.

Technical vulnerability tests such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be performed to identify the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of network or systems when necessary. Before conducting the vulnerability scanning and/or penetration testing, the assessment team should agree with the B/D on the scope, possible impact and fallback/recovery procedure. This should be based on the Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan if mission critical systems are involved.

Vulnerability scanning at network, hosts and systems should be performed to cover at least the following where appropriate:

* Network level probing/scanning and discovery

* Host vulnerability tests and discovery

* System/application (including web system/application) scanning

The assessment team should review whether patches or compensating measures have been applied for all applicable known vulnerabilities including but not limited to all relevant security alerts issued by the Government Computer Emergency Response Team Hong Kong (GovCERT.HK).

For Internet-facing web applications processing classified information, websites with input fields or mission critical systems, web penetration testing should also be performed.

For details on vulnerability scanning and/or penetration testing, please refer to <<vulnerability_analysis>> – Vulnerability Analysis.


==== Risk Analysis

Risk analysis helps to determine the value of the assets and their associated risks. Risk analysis on every aspect should be performed which include, but is not limited to, the following:

* Human resource security

* Asset management

* Access control

* Cryptography

* Physical and environmental security

* Operations security

* Communications security

* System acquisition, development and maintenance

* Outsourcing security

* IT security aspects of business continuity management

In general, this process can be divided into several sub-processes as shown in <<fig2>> above. They are:

* Asset Identification and Valuation

* Threat Analysis

* Vulnerability Analysis

* Asset/Threat/Vulnerability Mapping

* Impact and Likelihood Assessment

* Risk Results Analysis

Each of these sub-processes is explained briefly in later sub-sections.

Furthermore, B/Ds can refer to the assurance model in "Risk Assessment Reference Framework for Electronic Authentication" in analysing the risks relating to registration and authentication process of the electronic service, including government-to-citizen (G2C) and government-to-employee (G2E) applications.

===== Asset Identification and Valuation

All assets included within the scope of security risk assessment, both tangible and intangible, such as information, services, reputation, hardware and software, communications, interfaces, physical assets, supporting utilities, personnel and access control measures must be identified.

Data classification is a key input to the assessment process and each asset can be classified into different categories. For example, an asset can be grouped under a process, an application, a physical asset, a network or a certain kind of information. The purpose is to show the importance of these assets to the systems or areas under assessment.

It should be noted that the asset valuation approach will be different and will depend on the analysis method adopted. The risk analysis methods are explained in <<risk_result_analysis>> – Risk Results Analysis.

Values of assets can be expressed in terms of:

* Tangible values such as replacement costs of IT facilities, hardware, software, system data, media, supplies, documentation, and IT staff supporting the systems.

* Intangible values such as goodwill and improved service quality.

* Information values, e.g. confidentiality, integrity and availability.

* Data classification of the information stored, processed, or transmitted by the asset.

The output of asset identification and valuation process is an inventory checklist of assets with their corresponding values, if any, in terms of their tangible values, intangible values, or information values in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. The more specific values the assets are needed, the more time is required to complete this process.

The output checklist may include the following items, but not limited to:

* Name and type of the information assets.

* Physical location of the assets.

* Storage media and retention period before information stored/processed is destroyed.

* Nature of information stored/processed such as backup or original copy.

* Indicator showing the importance/values of the assets such as the sensitivity levels, operation needs or criticality.

* Incoming/outgoing information flow such as information transmission mode via email, dial-up modems or other telecommunication links.

* Software installed.

* Development and maintenance costs.

* Values of each identified assets.

===== Threat Analysis

A threat is a potential event or any circumstance with the potential to adversely impact the information assets, systems and networks, in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Threat analysis may need to be occasionally revised to reflect any new potential threats to the information asset.

Examples of sources of threats are:

* Human errors

* Disgruntled employees

* Malicious or careless personnel

* Misuse of systems and computer resources

* Computer fraud

* Theft

* Industrial espionage

* Environmental disasters

Threat analysis is to identify the threats and to determine the likelihood of their occurrence and their potential to harm systems or assets. System errors or control logs can be a good source of data, which can be converted into threat event information and statistics.

Threats can be categorised into three main types:

* _Social threats_ : directly related to human factors, can be intentional or unintentional, such as human errors, results of omission or negligence, theft, fraud, misuse, damage, destruction, disclosure and modification of data.

* _Technical threats_ : caused by technical problems such as wrong processes, design flaws, breakage of communication paths like cabling.

* _Environmental threats_ : caused by environmental disasters such as fire, water damage, power supply, and earthquake.

[[vulnerability_analysis]]
===== Vulnerability Analysis

Vulnerability is a weakness in operational, technical and other security controls and procedures that could be exploited by a threat, allowing assets to be compromised. Examples are the interception of data transmission and the unauthorised access of information by third parties. Vulnerability analysis is to identify and analyse the vulnerabilities of the system and environment. It is important to systematically measure these vulnerabilities.

Each vulnerability can be assigned with a level or degree (e.g. high, medium, low) to indicate its importance. Key and critical assets must first be identified.

Vulnerability identification will concentrate on identifying vulnerabilities, with the assistance of automated tools or programs, over the network using one of the following methods:

. Vulnerability Scanning
+
--
Assessment team can perform vulnerability scans, using an automated vulnerability scanning tool, to quickly identify known vulnerabilities on the target hosts or network devices. Similar to an anti-malware solution, scanning tools are installed on assessment team’s computer and require regular updating on the vulnerability signature files before use. Based on user requirements, a single or group of hosts/networks will be scanned for known vulnerable services (e.g. system allows anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP), sendmail relaying) to identify existence of any vulnerability.

Since a large amount of system requests could be generated from the automated vulnerability scanning tool, the system and network performance of the target groups for scanning may be impacted during the vulnerability scanning process. The assessment team should devise a plan with the system and network administrators to minimise possible service interruption during the vulnerability scanning.

Furthermore, it should be noted that some of the potential vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanning tool may not represent real vulnerabilities in the context of the system environment. For example, some of the "vulnerabilities" flagged by the automated scanning software may actually not vulnerable as there may already be compensating control in place. Thus, this test method may produce false positives and require professional judgment by the assessment team to determine the validity of the identified vulnerability.

Network vulnerability scanning is a good method to collect vulnerability information within a short period of time. In contrast to penetration testing, network vulnerability scanning is non-intrusive and does not attempt to exploit the identified vulnerability. Therefore, a penetration testing may be adopted if a more in-depth security analysis is required.

For applications such as web applications or mobile applications, application vulnerability scanning should be performed to discover security vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
--

. Penetration Testing
+
--
Penetration testing can be performed internally or externally. It involves manual process supplemented with automated tools, which may be installed on a portable computer, to scan the network or system to create a network map of connected workstations and servers, and to identify vulnerabilities from either inside or outside the network and system under study by attempting to penetrate them.

Penetration testing may also involve user interviews and the use of different hacking techniques to test the system or network. The level of details and types of hacking have to be thoroughly planned and agreed before proceeding. Hacking may stop after gaining access to a particular system, or after further in-depth analysis for the system being penetrated. Advice from vendor or security assessment team should be sought before deciding to perform hacking or not. Legal matters should be settled beforehand when dealing with external ethical hacking.

The objectives of the penetration testing include, but are not limited to the following:

* To identify security weaknesses by testing system's ability to withstand intentional attempts.

* To test and validate the efficiency of security protection and controls.

* To test the defensive ability to detect and respond to attacks.

Typical steps of a penetration testing are depicted in the <<fig3>> below:

[[fig3]]
.Typical Steps of a Penetration Testing
image::image-03.png[width=auto,height=auto]

B/Ds should pay special attention to penetration testing because the tests may bring impacts to the systems similar to real-world attacks, such as service disruption, unauthorised access or unauthorised data modification, etc. Thus, before conducting a penetration testing, B/Ds should consider the following security concerns:

* The scopes and objectives must be clearly defined; machines / systems outside the scope shall never be tested.

* The vendor should discuss and agree with the owner on suitability and impact of intrusive attacks and denial of service (DoS) attacks.

* The vendor performing the penetration test shall sign a non-disclosure agreement to protect the privacy or confidentiality of the data in the system.

* Only acquire the service from vendors with good credibility and track record. Consider to conduct background checks and qualification checks on the vendors to see if they possess necessary experience and expertise.

* Latest full system backup of the target systems must be available because the penetration tests may impact the integrity of the data in target system.

* Clearly define the "capture-the-flag" situation, such as placing a file in a designated directory, acquiring the password of some testing accounts, accessing designated web pages which should have proper access control, etc. Production data shall never be modified or deleted.

* Provide contact list to vendor for emergency contact, such as system owner, IT administrators. The staff will be the contact points for the vendor to report any emergency situation arisen during the tests.

* Get the contact list of the vendor so that B/D can stop all tests promptly, if necessary.

* Inform and alert the security monitoring vendor prior to the penetration testing unless it is intended to assess the effectiveness of the monitoring capability of the vendor.

* Get in advance the source IP addresses of the machines going to perform the testing so that it could be determined if an attack is genuine by examining and comparing the intrusion detection/prevention system logs.

* Consider to arrange the penetration tests to be conducted at non-peak working hours.

* Ensure the vendor will not modify any user data even if the vendor can successfully access the user data.

Examples of penetration testing are:

* Remote Internet firewall penetration tests: Internet Protocol (IP) address probing, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) probing, protocol-based DoS attacks such as Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flooding, Domain Name Service (DNS) spoofing, service-based penetration tests such as sendmail, brute-force password attacks and mail bombs.

* On-site firewall penetration tests: packet sniffing, IP address spoofing, source-routed packets and session hijacking.

* Telephony penetration tests: brute-force password attacks and war-diallers.

* Application penetration tests: include but not limited to configuration and deployment management testing, authentication testing, identity management testing, session management testing, error handling etc.

Tight access control on these automated tools shall be implemented to limit any unauthorised access and usage. As these tools are able to launch simulated attacks such as DoS attacks to your system or network, they should be closely monitored by the security assessment team and the system administrators when being used.

For more details on penetration testing, please refer to the Practice Guide for Penetration Testing.

===== Assets/Threats/Vulnerabilities Mapping

Mapping threats to assets and to vulnerabilities can help to identify their possible combinations. Each threat can be associated with a specific vulnerability, or even multiple vulnerabilities. Unless a threat can exploit a vulnerability, it would not be a risk to an asset.

The range of all possible combinations should be reduced prior to performing risk results analysis. Some combinations may not make sense or are not feasible. This interrelationship of assets, threats and vulnerabilities is critical to the analysis of security risks. Factors like project scope, budget and constraints may also affect the levels and magnitude of mappings.

===== Impact and Likelihood Assessment

Given the assets, threats and vulnerabilities, it is now possible to identify the impact and likelihood.

. Impact Assessment
+
Impact assessment, (or impact analysis or consequence assessment) is to estimate the degree of the overall harm or loss that could occur. Examples of impact are on revenues, profits, cost, service levels and government's reputation, damage to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the concerned system. It is necessary to consider about the level of risk that could be tolerated and how, what and when the assets could be affected by such risks. The more severe the consequences of a threat, the higher the risk.

. Likelihood Assessment
+
--
Likelihood assessment is to estimate the frequency of a threat happening, i.e. the probability of occurrence. It is necessary to observe the circumstances that will affect the likelihood of the risk occurring. In general, the likelihood of a threat exploiting a system’s vulnerability can be measured in terms of different circumstances such as its accessibility and its number of authorised users. The accessibility of a system can be affected by many factors such as physical access control, system configuration, network type, network topology and network interfaces. The system with Internet connection is more likely to have its vulnerabilities exploited than an internal system. Also, the former one may have a large number of authorised users (i.e. the public) than the latter internal system, which has limited number of users. A system with one user is clearly less likely to be exploited than a system with several hundreds or thousands of users. As more people can gain access to the system, it is more difficult to ensure that each individual user performs only those functions he or she is permitted to do. Normally, the likelihood of vulnerabilities exploited increases with the number of authorised users.

The likelihood can be expressed in terms of the frequency of occurrence such as once in a day, once in a month and once in a year. The greater the likelihood of a threat happening, the higher the risk. For example, if there had been a well-known vulnerability in application software, the likelihood of an intentional social threat exploiting this vulnerability is high. If the systems affected is very critical, then the impact is also very high. As a result, the risk of this threat is high.

For each identified risk, determine its impact and likelihood to give an overall estimated level of risk. Assumptions should be clearly defined when making the estimation.

[[risk_result_analysis]]
===== Risk Results Analysis

Risk results can be analysed using different methods and ways: Qualitative & Quantitative Methods, and Matrix Approach.

. Qualitative & Quantitative Methods
+
--
Qualitative method is to use descriptive, word scales or rankings of significance/severity based on experience and judgement. Examples are past experience, market research, industry practice and standards, surveys, interviews and specialists’/experts’ judgements. This method requires a subjective assignment of categories, e.g. levelling using high, medium or low, ordinal ranking from 1 to 5, or degree of importance from least to most significant etc. Qualitative measure is more subjective in nature.

For instance, the value of an asset can be expressed in terms of degree of importance, e.g. least significant, significant and most significant.

Quantitative method is to use numerical information to arrive at percentages or numerical values. An example is the cost/benefit analysis. But this method requires more time and resources than the qualitative method, as every possible element (i.e. asset, threat or vulnerability) has to be categorised and considered.

For example, the value of an asset can also be expressed in terms of monetary value such as the purchase costs or maintenance costs. Threat frequency can be expressed in terms of rate of occurrence, e.g. once a month or once every year.

Normally, a qualitative method is used for initial screening while a quantitative method is used for more detailed and specific analysis on some critical elements and for further analysis on high-risk areas.
--

. Matrix Approach
+
--
A matrix approach can be used to document and estimate the three major needs of security protection: confidentiality, integrity and availability in three different levels of severity (high, medium, low). The risk level can be ranked based on the criticality of each risk elements. Risk interpretation should better be limited to the most significant risks so as to reduce the overall effort and complexity.

<<table1>> shows a sample Risk Ranking Matrix of a particular threat on a particular function or asset. For the Impact and Likelihood columns, a value is assigned to each entry indicating the status (3-high, 2-medium and 1-low). As the risk level is the multiplication of the Impact's and the Likelihood's values, it will thus has a value ranging from 1 to 9 (9 – high, 4 & 6 – medium, 1 to 3 - low) excluding 5, 7 and 8 since the multiple of the above two values (Impact's & Likelihood's) cannot be 5, 7 or 8. With this matrix, it is possible to classify each threat into one overall risk level.

[[table1]]
.A Sample of Risk Ranking Matrix
|===
h| Risk Categories h| Impact (High, Medium, Low) h| Likelihood (High, Medium, Low) h| Risk Level = Impact X Likelihood (High, Medium, Low)
| Confidentiality ^.^| 3 ^.^| 2 ^.^| _6_
| Integrity ^.^| 3 ^.^| 1 ^.^| _3_
| Availability ^.^| 2 ^.^| 1 ^.^| _2_
| Overall ^.^| 3 ^.^| 2 ^.^| _6_
|===

Remarks for <<table1>>:

High Impact:: Most significant: major loss and seriously damaging the organisation; severe, catastrophic, or serious long-term damage/disruption +
e.g. DoS; unauthorised access to system

Medium Impact:: Significant: medium loss which would be detrimental to the organisation; serious short-term, or limited long-term damage/disruption +
e.g. intruder may gather system critical information to gain unauthorised access or launch further attacks

Low Impact:: Least significant: low loss which would cause little or no damaging to the organisation; limited and short-term damage/disruption +
e.g. intruder may gain non-critical information for processing

High Likelihood:: Expected to occur in most circumstances

Medium Likelihood:: Should occur occasionally

Low Likelihood:: Could occur at specific time or in exceptional circumstances

High Risk Level:: A low tolerance to risk exposures, i.e. requiring the highest security protection

Medium Risk Level:: A medium tolerance to risk exposures

Low Risk Level:: A high tolerance to risk exposures

Overall Result:: Equal to the highest security risk level in various risk categories

This matrix can be further extended by classifying sub-categories for risk exposures and with more weighted, numerical values for risk levels.

Once the risk level is identified, a list of technical, operational and administrative requirements can be produced for each identified asset. This provides a basis for making decisions to accept, reduce, avoid or transfer the risk as risks cannot be completely removed as shown in <<table2>>.

[[table2]]
.List of Risk Options
|===
| When | Options | Description
| - Consequences/likelihood are low +
- Usability or other factors overweigh security | Accept risk | To bear the liability
| - It is a high risk and cannot be accepted. | Reduce risk | To reduce the consequences or the likelihood, or both
| - The risks are too high or too costly to be reduced and is unmanageable | Avoid risk | To use alternative means or not to proceed with the task that would cause the risk
| - Another party is willing to accept the risk +
- Another party has greater control over the risk | Transfer risk | To shift the responsibility for the risk to other party either partially or fully
|===

For any of the options selected, recommendations on how to proceed with the selected option have to be made to management. Besides, safeguards and security controls have to be suggested if it is decided to reduce risk.

Priority should then be given to each risk to indicate its significance and potential impact. Normally the higher the security risk level, the higher priority should be given. In other words, higher priority risks are usually unacceptable and require more attention from management.
--

==== Identifying and Selecting Safeguards

After reviewing the results of security risk assessment, safeguards may be identified and evaluated for their effectiveness. Security assessment team would recommend possible safeguards to reduce the likelihood and impact of identified threats and vulnerabilities to an acceptable level.

===== Common Types of Safeguards

Safeguards can be quick fixes for problems found on existing system configurations or planned enhancements. Safeguards can be technical or procedural controls.

In general, safeguards can be classified into three common types:

* Barriers : keep unauthorised parties completely away from accessing critical resources.

* Hardening : make unauthorised parties difficult to gain access to critical resources.

* Monitoring : help to detect and respond to an attack promptly and correctly.

Examples of safeguards:

* Develop/enhance the departmental IT security policy, guidelines or procedures to ensure effective security.

* Re-configure operating systems, network components and devices to cater for the weaknesses identified during the security risk assessment.

* Implement password control procedures or authentication mechanism to ensure strong passwords.

* Implement encryption or authentication technology to protect data transmission.

* Enhance physical security protection.

* Develop security incident handling and reporting procedures.

* Develop staff awareness and training programs to ensure compliance with security requirements.


===== Major Steps of Identifying & Selecting Safeguards

The selection of appropriate security safeguards is not simple. It requires knowledge and technical skills on the system. The cost of managing risks needs to commensurate with the risk exposure. That is, the cost of reducing risk on a specific asset should not exceed the total value of that asset.

Below are several major steps of identifying and selecting safeguards:

* Select appropriate safeguards for each targeted vulnerability.

* Identify the costs associated with each safeguard such as the development, implementation and maintenance costs.

* Match safeguard/vulnerability pairs to all threats, i.e. develop a relationship between these measures and the threats.

* Determine and quantify the impact of the safeguard, i.e. the extent of risk that can be reduced after applying the selected safeguards.

Different combinations of physical, managerial, procedural, operational and technical based safeguards may be required. An analysis may be required to determine the optimal combinations for different circumstances.

A single safeguard may reduce risk for a number of threats. Several numbers of safeguards may act to reduce risk for only one threat. Hence, the integration of all safeguards shows the overall gross risk reduction benefit as a whole.

The effects of using different safeguards should be tested before implementation. Hence, this selection process may need to be performed several times to see how the proposed changes affect the risk results.

However, there are also other factors that have to be considered other than those identified in security risk assessment.

For example,

* Organisational factors like department's goals and objectives.

* Relevant statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.

* Cultural factors such as social custom, beliefs, working styles.

* Quality requirements such as safety, reliability, system performance.

* Time constraints.

* Supporting services and functions.

* Technical, procedural and operational requirements and controls.

* Existing technology available in the market.


==== Monitoring and Implementation

Risk assessment results should be properly documented. This enables the security risk assessment process to be audited. This also facilitates on-going monitoring and reviewing.

Re-assessment should be conducted whenever necessary. It is essential to keep track of the changing environment and the changing priority of the identified risks and their impact. Security audit is one of the ways to review the implementation of security measures.

Roles and responsibilities of related personnel such as operators, system developers, network administrators, information owners, security officers and users should be clearly defined, reviewed and assigned to support the safeguard implementation. Management should commit resources and provide support to monitoring and controlling the implementation.


=== Common Security Risk Assessment Tasks

Below are some common tasks that will be performed in security risk assessment for reference. The actual tasks to be performed will depend on the assessment scope and user requirements.

* Identify business needs and changes to requirements that may affect overall IT and security direction.

* Identify and document all relevant statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to the operations of each information system.

* Analyse assets, threats, vulnerabilities, their impacts and likelihood.

* Assess physical protection applied to computing equipment and other network components.

* Conduct technical and procedural review and analysis on the network architecture, protocols and components.

* Review and check the configuration, implementation and usage of remote access systems, servers, firewalls, and external network connections, including the client Internet connection.

* Review password and other authentication mechanisms.

* Review current level of security awareness and commitment of staff within the organisation.

* Review agreements involving services or products from vendors and contractors.

* Develop practical technical recommendations to address the vulnerabilities identified, and to reduce the level of security risk.

=== Deliverables

At different stages of security risk assessment, there may be different deliverables. A table with a list of deliverables is shown below in <<table3>>. <<annexB>> gives some examples of contents of these deliverables for reference.

[[table3]]
.List of Deliverables
|===
h| Item h| Tasks h| Deliverables h| Brief Description
|1 | Security requirement identification | Security Requirement Report | A report which shows the user security requirements, with regard to identified assets, threats, vulnerabilities and their impacts.
| 2 | Security risk assessment | Security Risk Assessment Report | A report which shows the results of security risk assessment with identified assets, threats, vulnerabilities, impacts and recommendations for enhancement.
|3 | Review existing security policies, guidelines and procedures | New/Revised Security Policy, Guidelines and Procedures | One or a set of security related documents to control the implementation of the security protection measures for areas under assessment.
|===

[[security_audit]]
== Security Audit

Security Audit is an audit on the level of compliance with the security policy or standards as a basis to determine the overall state of the existing protection and to verify whether the existing protection has been performed properly. It targets at finding out whether the current environment is securely protected in accordance with the defined security policy. It should be performed periodically to ensure the compliance of the security policies and effective implementation of security measures.

A security audit will require security policy and standards, audit checklists and an inventory list, which may cover different areas such as web application, network architecture, wireless communication, etc. <<annexC>> lists different audit areas. <<annexD>> provides a sample checklist where items to be checked under different security areas. Security audit may also involve the use of different auditing tools and different review techniques in order to reveal the security non-compliance and loopholes. After the audit process, an audit report will be prepared to highlight the conformance and gaps existed between the current protection and the requirements specified in the security policies.

The selection of auditors and conduct of audits shall ensure objectivity and impartiality of the audit process. As a general principle, auditors shall not audit their own work.

The major objectives of a security audit are to:

* Check for compliance to existing security policy, standards, guidelines and procedures.

* Identify the inadequacies and examine the effectiveness of the existing policy, standards, guidelines and procedures.

* Identify and review relevant statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.

* Identify and understand the existing vulnerabilities.

* Review existing security controls on operational, administrative and managerial issues, ensure effective implementation of security measures and compliance to minimum security standards.

* Provide recommendations and corrective actions for improvements.


=== Frequency and Timing of Audit

==== Audit Frequency

Security audit is an on-going activity, and is not a one-off event. Security audits should be conducted periodically to ensure compliance of security policy, guidelines, and procedures, and to determine the minimum set of controls required to reducing risk to an acceptable level. It should be noted that a security audit only gives a snapshot of the vulnerabilities revealed at a particular point in time.

==== Audit Timing

There are different scenarios when a security audit should be performed. The exact timing depends on your system requirements and resources.

* New Installation/Enhancement Audits: prior to implementation or major enhancements, in order to ensure conformance to existing policies and guidelines and meet the configuration standard.

* Regular Audits: conduct audits periodically, e.g. once a year, either manually or automatically using security-related tools in order to assure the minimum set of controls are implemented to detect and handle security loopholes or vulnerabilities.

* Random Audits: to perform random checks in order to reflect the actual practice.

* Nightly or Non-Office Hour Audits: to reduce the auditing risks by performing during non-office hours or at night.

=== Auditing Tools

There are many automated tools which can help to find vulnerabilities. The choice of auditing tools depends on the security needs and the workload impact of monitoring.

For instance, some security scanning tools can check for any existing vulnerabilities on the network (network-based) or on specific hosts (host-based) through scanning and launching simulated attacks. Results are then shown in reports for further analysis.

These commercially available tools may be used together with security auditors' own developed tools. Latest tools used in the hacker community may also be used by security auditors to simulate the emerging attack activities.

Manual review techniques such as social engineering attacks and auditing checklists
may be applied for non-technical reviews on all levels of security awareness within
the organisation.

=== Auditing Steps

In general, a security audit can be divided into the following steps:

* Planning

* Collecting audit data

* Performing audit tests

* Reporting for audit results

* Protecting audit data and tools

* Making enhancements and follow-up

[[fig4]]
.General Audit Steps
image::image-04.png[width=auto,height=auto]


==== Planning

Planning helps to determine and select effective and efficient methods for performing the audit and obtaining all necessary information. The required time for planning depends on the nature, extent and complexity of the audit.

===== Project Scopes and Objectives

Audit scopes and objectives should be clearly defined and established. User requirements should be identified and agreed with security auditors before proceeding.

Examples of security audit scopes are:

* Internet security

* General security of an internal network

* Mission-critical systems

* Hosts security

* Network server's security such as web servers, email servers etc.

* Network components and devices such as firewalls, routers etc.

* General security of a computer room

* Network services such as directory services, mailing services, remote access services

Some audit objectives are listed below for reference:

* To provide evidence of compliance with the system security policy.

* To examine and analyse the safeguards of the system and the operational environment.

* To assess the technical and non-technical implementation of the security design.

* To validate proper or improper integration and operation of all security features.

===== Constraints

The period allowed for auditing should be adequate and sufficient enough to complete all tests. Sometimes the systems or networks have to be off-line or not in live production when performing the audit. Possible service interruption may occur. Backup and recovery of existing configuration and information must be performed before starting the security audit.

===== Roles and Responsibilities

Similar to conducting a security risk assessment, the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved should be carefully and clearly defined. Typical members involved can be referenced to "<<roles_and_responsibilities_of_stakeholders>> Roles and Responsibilities of Stakeholders".

In particular, the security auditors, after their appointment, should plan for pre-audit by:

* Identifying and verifying the current environment via documentation, interviews, meetings and manual review.

* Identifying the significant areas or operations that are related to the audit.

* Identifying the general controls that may have effects on the audit.

* Estimating and identifying the resources required such as the auditing tools and manpower.

* Identifying any special or additional processing for the audit.

A security audit must be properly controlled and authorised before proceeding. A communication channel must be established between B/Ds and the security auditors.

On the other hand, there are two major areas that should be considered beforehand:

* Independence of Security Auditors
+
It is required to consider whether the appointed security auditor is appropriate for the nature of the planned security audit. An independent and trusted party should be chosen to ensure a true, fair and objective view. The hiring of internal or external security auditors should be carefully planned, especially when dealing with classified information. The selection of auditors and conduct of audits shall ensure objectivity and impartiality of the audit process. Auditors shall not audit their own work.

* Staffing
+
The audit should be performed by auditors with sufficient skills and experience accompanied by system administrators. Roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of each involved party should be clearly defined and assigned.

==== Collecting Audit Data

It is required to determine how much and what type of information to be captured, and how to filter, store, access and review the audit data and logs.

The amount of data collected depends on the audit scope, objectives and data availability.

Careful planning is required for data collection. Such collection shall be in accordance with the government rules and regulations, and shall not create or initiate other potential security threats and vulnerabilities. All necessary data shall be collected, properly stored and protected from unauthorised access.

Audit data can be collected and stored in different ways. For example,

* Log files such as system start up and shut down information, logon and logout attempts, commands executed, access violations, accounts and password changes.

* Reports such as audit trails, journals, summaries, details reports for all transactions, statistics reports or exception reports.

* Storage media such as optical disks.

Apart from electronic data collection, some physical or manual events should also be recorded and collected for future reference.

Examples are:

* Computer equipment repair and maintenance activities such as date, time, supporting vendor information and the activity's description.

* Change control and administration events such as configuration changes, installation of new software, data conversion or patches updating.

* Physical site visits by external parties such as security auditors or guests.

* Procedures and policy changes.

* Operation logs.

* Security incident records.

In general, the audit data collection steps may follow information gathering techniques as those in a security risk assessment. However, instead of assessing the risk exposures in the environment, the objective of a security audit is to review existing security controls on operational, administrative and managerial issues, and ensure compliance to established security standards. Audit data, or evidence, is collected to support whether proper security controls are in place and enforced appropriately. For details of the data collection techniques, please refer to Section <<information_gathering>> – Information Gathering.

==== Performing Audit Tests

After thorough planning and data collection, security auditors may perform:

* A general review on the existing security policies or standards according to the defined scope of audit.

* A general review on the security configurations.

* Technical investigation by using different automated tools for diagnostic review and/or penetration tests.

Depending on the audit scope, different systems or network may be involved in a security audit. <<annexC>> provides the purposes and coverages of different audit areas.

==== Reporting for Audit Results

A security audit report is required upon completion of audit work. Security auditors should analyse the auditing results and provide a report, which reflects the current security status. Performing further analysis on reports generated from scanning tools is necessary to remove non-applicable findings and false positives. The severity level may need to be adjusted in accordance with B/Ds’ environment.

This audit report must be comprehensible by different readers such as IT management, executive management, related system administrators and owners, and the auditing and controlling sections.

See also <<annexB>> for the suggested contents of a security audit report.


==== Protecting Audit Data & Tools

Throughout stages of the security audit, it is essential to safeguard the audit data and tools.

Audit data and all physical documents relating to the audit shall also be classified to an appropriate level and protected according to their classification.

The auditing tools should be properly maintained, controlled and monitored to avoid misuse. Such tools should only be used by the security auditors in a controlled manner. These tools should also be removed immediately after use unless proper control has been made to protect them from unauthorised access.

Security auditors shall also return all audit information to corresponding B/Ds after completing their audit services. The arrangement shall be agreed with security auditors in advance before their appointment.

==== Making Enhancements and Follow-up

If corrective actions are required, resources should be allocated to ensure that the enhancements could be performed at the earliest opportunity. Details of follow-up can be referred in the later section.


== Service Pre-requisites & Common Activities

=== Assumptions and Limitations

In conducting a security risk assessment or audit, a few assumptions have been made.

* There are limited time and resources.

* It is intended to mitigate and manage security risks as comprehensive as possible.

=== Client Responsibilities

When performing security risk assessment or audit by an external party, B/Ds should observe and be responsible for the following activities:

* Conduct background checks and qualification checks on supporting vendor and security consultants / auditors, to ensure that they possess necessary experience and expertise.

* Prepare an agreement for supporting vendor to sign, including but are not limited to the disclaimer of liability, the service details, and statement of non-disclosure, before starting any assessment or auditing activities. This is especially important when deciding to perform external penetration testing such as war dialling or hacking into the internal network from the Internet.

* Assign staff to be the primary and/or secondary points of contact for the vendor.

* Provide contact lists to vendor for both office and non-office hours whenever necessary.

* Be cooperative and open-minded. Acknowledge the results and develop plans for improvement if there are security needs.

* Allow physical and logical access only to the systems, network or computer equipment, which are necessary to perform the evaluations, and protect all assets that may be affected by this service.

* Obtain formal notification from the vendor about the level of impact or damage on the network, services or system during the testing, so that recovery scheme and appropriate incident handling procedure could be ready before proceeding.

* Provide response to enquiries from security consultants / auditors within a reasonable time span.

* Provide sufficient office space and office equipment for the vendor to perform their service; a restricted area is preferred.

* Provide all necessary documentation about the specific area under assessment such as logging policy or log review procedures, e.g. records of access log checking.

* Hold regular meeting with vendor for project control and review.

* Apply changes or enhancements at the earliest convenience after assessing the risk involved with fallback procedure ready, especially those that were at very high risks.

=== Service Pre-requisites

The following pre-requisites should be met:

* Provide all necessary documented information, either formal or informal, such as network diagrams, operation manual, user access control lists, security policy, standards, guidelines, and procedures. Please refer to Annex E for a sample list of documented information as evidence of compliance.

* Provide personnel support related to the areas under study, including Internet usage, firewall configuration, network and system management, security needs and requirements and so on.

* Arrange guided site visit to gather more information for the assessment.

* Choose independent third party to conduct security audit.

=== Responsibilities of Security Consultant / Auditors

In performing security risk assessment or audit for a B/D, the security consultants / auditors should:

* Possess the necessary skills and expertise.

* Understand the impact of every tool and estimate impact to the B/D.

* Obtain proper written authorisation from other necessary parties such as Internet Service Provider (ISP) and police, especially when performing hacking tests.

* Document every test regardless whether it is successful.

* Ensure that the report reflects B/D’s security policy and operational needs.

* Exercise good judgment in reporting immediately any significant security risk findings to the B/D.

== Follow-Up of Security Risk Assessment & Audit

=== Importance of Follow-Up

The benefit of security risk assessment and audit is not in the recommendations made, but in their effective implementation. When a recommendation is made, the management is basically responsible for implementing it. If management has made the decision of not implementing a recommendation, they have to bear the associated security risk. Adequate reasons should be provided to support the decision.

There are three major areas of concern with regard to recommendations made in the security risk assessment and audit:

[[fig5]]
.Follow-Up Actions on Recommendations
image::image-05.png[width=auto,height=auto]

=== Effective & Qualified Recommendations

Security consultants / auditors are required to produce effective and qualified recommendations, which should possess the following characteristics:

* Specific and clear, readily understandable and identifiable

* Convincing and persuasive with sufficient evidence

* Significant

* Feasible and practical

In addition, the recommendations should be able to deal with the actual causes of problems, and should propose the best alternatives with supporting evidence and justifications. All these recommendations must be submitted to management which, in turn, has the authority to approve and enforce the recommendations.

=== Commitment

Individual and departmental commitment is important for implementation of the recommendations. Security consultants / auditors, staff and management may have different interests, emphasis and priority given to the recommendations.

==== Security Consultants / Auditors

Security consultants / auditors are those who first introduce the recommendations for improvement. They should:

* have confidence on their recommendations and if followed, there would be desirable improvements;

* understand the B/D's environment and its constraints such as time, resources and culture; and

* communicate through an appropriate and effective channel to give their recommendations.

==== Staff

Staff are specifically referred to those who would be directly or indirectly affected by the recommendations. They may need to provide support for implementing the recommendations, or they are actually the users who may have to change their daily operation procedures. They should be:

* encouraged and motivated to co-operate with the security consultants / auditors;

* given sufficient time and resources to perform the enhancements; and

* assured that they would benefit from the recommendations.

==== Management

Management plays an important role in enforcing the enhancements. They should:

* be proactive rather than reactive on security matters;

* provide sufficient support throughout the assessment or audit process;

* allocate sufficient resources for making the enhancements;

* understand that follow-up is a valuable and significant responsibility;

* encourage prompt enhancements with adequate planning, control and communication; and

* promote staff awareness and training.

=== Monitoring and Follow-Up

Monitoring and follow-up consists of three major steps:

* Set up an effective monitoring and follow-up system.

* Identify recommendations and develop follow-up plan.

* Perform active monitoring and reporting.

==== Set Up Monitoring and Follow-up System

Management should set up a monitoring and follow-up system to follow up the recommendations. Besides those responsible for the security risk assessment or audit, management may assign additional staff to oversee the overall effectiveness of the monitoring system.

Management is responsible for providing adequate support, overall guidance and direction. It can establish scope, objectives and functions of the monitoring system. In addition, basic rules and guidelines can be set up as a general reference for performing security assessment monitoring and follow-up.

==== Identify Recommendations & Develop Follow-up Plans

To perform effective and prompt enhancements, the following have to be done:

* Identify key, significant and critical recommendations in which additional monitoring and maximum effort should be used.

* Develop a follow-up plan for all recommendations; this may include implementation plan, estimated time, action lists, results verification procedures and methods.

* Report and emphasise on key recommendations and highlight the follow-up process.

* Follow up all recommendations according to the plan.

==== Perform Active Monitoring & Reporting

Proactively monitoring and reporting the progress and status of actions, and taking follow-up actions on all recommendations are required until implementation is completed.

===== Progress & Status of Actions

There are different progress and status of actions:

* Actions not yet started

* Completed actions

* Actions being undertaken with a target completion date

* Reasons for actions not being taken

* Alternative actions if different from recommendations

===== Follow-Up Actions

Some follow-up actions are suggested for considerations:

* Review the implementation plans, documentation and time frames for planned actions.

* Find the underlying reasons why the action was not taken.

* Establish additional steps or tasks to handle the technical, operational or managerial difficulties.

* Find alternative recommendations due to unexpected environmental or requirement changes.

* Determine the "closing" of recommendations when they are proved to be successfully implemented and tested, to be no longer valid, or to be unsuccessful even after further actions.

* Assess the effectiveness of the corrective actions.

* Report accomplishment, status and progress to management.

* Escalate to management whenever applicable, especially when implementation of key recommendations is inadequate or delayed.

== Different Audit Areas

=== Firewall

This audit area is to ensure that its firewall and associated systems have been properly configured to enforce the security policy with the minimal and optimal security protection. The firewall should be audited not only for its configuration, but also for its physical access control.

This audit area may cover the following:

* Physical access control to the firewall host

* Firewall operating system version and patches

* Firewall configuration and controls on Internet traffic such as rulebase and ports opened

* Services permitted or disallowed to go through the firewall

* Current architecture of Internet connection such as connections with routers, proxy servers, email servers and web servers

* Connection with other third party products for additional services such as malware detection and repair measure

* Remote connection support and configuration

* Administration and change control procedures

* Access control list if any

The security audit report should be delivered summarising the firewall evaluation and recommendations in the firewall architecture, configuration, administration and operation.

=== Internal Network

The goal of this audit area is to discover any vulnerability that could be exploited by authorised internal users, and to identify any weaknesses and strengths in the controls of the internal systems and networks. The topology of internal network infrastructure may be reviewed as well.

The audit test usually includes an internal network scan to check for any security holes on specified times or pre-agreed periods. The scanning on critical hosts or workstations may be included.

This audit area would likely cover:

* Scanning of internal workstations, servers or network to identify hosts, services and network configuration.

* Identifying vulnerabilities, protocol and configuration errors on operating systems, internal firewalls, routers, network components and infrastructure.

* Attempting intrusion of internal network and systems.

* Evaluating internal security related to access control and monitoring, administration and change control procedures and practices.

* Recommending measures to strengthen the network security.

=== External Network

The goal of this audit area is to identify security weaknesses of the systems and networks from outside such as the Internet. This helps to anticipate external attacks that might cause security breaches by scanning and launching attacks (i.e. hacking) from Internet to internal network at specified and pre-agreed time and locations.

The audit area would cover:

* Scanning internal servers for ports and services vulnerable to attack.

* Scanning external network gateways to identify ports, services and topology.

* Attempting to gather internal configuration information from external.

* Launching intrusion attacks to internal systems from external.

Agreements must be set up to clearly define the auditing scope and testing level details, e.g. which network segments/components or the acceptable severity of attack. The security auditor must commit to minimising disruptions and avoiding damage to the systems and network.

=== Host Security

The purpose of this audit area is to assess the operating system level security of different computer platforms. Misconfiguration of the operating system may open up security loopholes that may not be known by the system administrators.

When considering the operating system security, accounts & password management, files system, networking workgroups, access permissions and auditing are all common components that should not be omitted. Details are elaborated as follows:

Accounts and Password Management

* Password control policy such as password minimum or maximum length

* User profiles, privileges and permissions

* Default user or administration accounts

* Group accounts

* Account policy such as account lockout, account validity period

Files System

* System files protection and access permissions

* Files access control lists

* Network Files System (NFS) usage

Networking Workgroups

* Domain and trust relationships

* Workgroups

* Shared directories

* Replicated directories

* Remote access control

Access Permissions

* Default directory permission

* Shared workstation permission

* Shared printer permission

* Registry permission

* Shared files permission

Auditing

* Event logs/system logs/error logs auditing

* File and directory auditing

* Registry auditing

* Printer auditing

* Alerts

* Accounting and audit trail protections

=== Internet Security

This audit area is to identify security weaknesses of the systems and networks in connection with the Internet. It is a combination of the internal network and external network audit areas with focus on the Internet gateway.

This audit area includes, but not limited to, the following items:

* Firewall and routers configuration

* Security controls on host servers such as web server, mail server, authentication servers

* Host, system and network security administration, and the control policy and procedures

* Physical security of the Internet gateway network components and servers

* Network security in Internet gateway segment and interfaces with internal network

* DoS or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks from external to the internal Internet gateway

* Compromise of the internal network components

=== Remote Access

The audit area will deal with vulnerabilities associated with remote access services via communication links such as dial-up connections and broadband connections (e.g. VPN, SSL VPN, etc.) This audit area may involve the following activities:

* Use automatic dialling/connection software to identify remote access users.

* Review security and configuration of remote access servers and the network where they are located.

* Conduct site visits to review the physical controls and location of modems or remote connection devices.

* Establish a remote access control policy or procedure.

Remote access without controls may open up a backdoor to external side. The problem is how to establish a secure connection.

The followings may be identified and reviewed under this audit area:

* Applications/services requiring remote access and their security requirements

* Any existing policies and procedures pertaining to remote access

* Existing remote access connections such as using modems, remote access servers, modem pool connections, or broadband connections

* Identifying any unauthorised or rogue access points.

* Attempting to establish connection to the wireless communication.

* Attempting to gather internal system information through the wireless communication.

* Assessing if site survey is conducted and the coverage of wireless communication of the site.

* Assessing if the encryption key is properly protected at the client devices.

=== Phone Line

The goal of the audit area is to identify undocumented or uncontrolled modems connecting internal computers directly to the telephone network. This helps to eliminate any unauthorised or inappropriate modem connection and configuration to internal network and systems.

The audit area would cover:

* Assessing each modem entry point connected.

* Identifying any undocumented dial-up entry points.

* Attempting to establish connection to internal network.

* Attempting to gather internal system information through the connection.

=== Web / Mobile Application

The audit area will deal with vulnerabilities associated with web / mobile applications. The following tests should be included in the audit area:

* Validating if security requirements are defined in early stage.

* Validating if security requirements specified in the functional specification document are met by the security controls implemented.

* Validating if malformed user inputs are handled or filtered.

* Assessing information leakage from error messages and meta data in the HTTP header for web application.

* Replaying security test cases prepared in the system acceptance test document for assuring proper security controls are maintained.

* Assessing the network and application architecture of the web / mobile application.

* Assessing if proper access control mechanisms are in place.

* Assessing the encryption mechanisms and protocols.

* Assessing the privilege of web / mobile application programs.

For best practices on web application security, please refer to Practice Guide for Website and Web Application Security.

=== Security Policy, Guidelines & Procedures

The objective is to review the existing security policy, guidelines and procedures. The review can focus on high-level / overall / organisation-wide security policy, or on specific systems, networks or components under concerns.

Below are some sample components under concerns:

* Remote access control
